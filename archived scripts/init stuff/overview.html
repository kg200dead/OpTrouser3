<br><h2>Operation Trouser</h2>
<p>As a vital part of the invasion of Podagorsk, we need to hold the one road bridge across the river. You must capture this bridge, designated Objective Pitt, and hold it at all costs until relieved.</p>
<p>The drop will be made just after midnight. The moon is nearly full, so there should be plenty of light.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p>The secondary objective for tonight is a hotel overlooking the bridge, designated <marker name='Objective_Stallone'>Objective Stallone</marker>. As this commands an overlook of the bridge, it should also be taken quickly.</p>
