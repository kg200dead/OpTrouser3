<p>
<! ------victory------>
You held the bridge until relieved!<br>
Well done, great job!<br>
The invasion's left flank is secure, and our armour has a crossing point.

<h2><a name="Debriefing:End2">Mission failed... Bridge not held</a></h2>
<br><br>
<p>
The bridge isn't ours! With the bridge in German hands, the enemy can slow our advance and the left flank of the invasion is painfully exposed, which will cost us many lives and may ultimately thwart the invasion.

<br>
<h2><a name="Debriefing:End3">Mission failed... Bridge destroyed</a></h2>
<br><br>
<p>
The bridge has been destroyed! Whilst this means the left flank of the invasion is secure, as an enemy counterattack won't be able to use the bridge, it also slows our advance on Paris.
<br>

<! ------KIA------>
<h2><a name="Debriefing:Killed">Fiasco!</a></h2>
<br>
<p>
The whole airborne force was wiped out to a man.<br>
Whilst their efforts have caused disruption to the German defences, with the bridges in German hands, the left flank of the invasion is painfully exposed, and the whole invasion is now in question, so their sacrifice was ultimately in vain.
